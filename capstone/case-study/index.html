            <div class="content">
                <p>My goal with my capstone project was to tackle issues in the environmental space and/or bring controversial ethical issues to light. I struggled with the broad nature of these problems, and how to narrow it enough for a single project. Through mind-mapping, I explored possible speculative, illustrative, and data-driven narratives. My interest in animal advocacy was a strong theme throughout my ideas, so I decided to hone in on that and focus on animal agriculture, since it relates to both environmental degradation as well as ethically problematic practices.</p>

                <p>The goal of the project is to encourage awareness about the horrific practices that happen within the animal agriculture industry, and the impact these have on the environment. I want people to consider how their daily habits are affecting other sentient beings and the planet. The target audience is young adults in their 20's, who are more open to changing habits than older generations, and also have the independence to do so.</p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>My design was heavily inspired by a scroll narrative about the phases of sleep and impacts of sleep deprivation, as well as a climate impact data visualization project. The sleep project was heavily data-driven, with statistics modifying and highlighting parts of the images that appeared. In addition to the technical aspect, there were also many prominently featured illustrations throughout different sections. My initial inclination was to lean heavily on data visualizations, and incorporate some illustrations. However, due to the heavy subject matter of the project, I wanted to let words take the spotlight. I aimed to generate emotional appeal through imagination, and instead highlight everyday objects and change the way people think about these ordinary things. I investigated other data visualization projects on <a href="https://sidebar.io/">sidebar.io</a> and noticed that minimalistic designs with limited color palettes effectively communicated key ideas without much distraction.</p>

                <div class="side-by-side1">
                    <p>Staying consistent with my findings from my UX Research, I worked with a limited color palette. I chose a deep red as the primary theme color, due to its ominous feel and association with violence. For my second most prominent color, I chose an olive green, which was reminiscent of vegetation, the planet, and could heavily contrast with the burgundy. I originally tried a very dark gray for the background, since I wanted to add to the dark tone of the subject matter. However, it reminded me too much of streamlined tech-focused interfaces, while I wanted to capture a more organic look that better related to agriculture and the planet. To solve this, I created a grainy beige background, and applied subtle graininess to all my outlined objects.</p>

                    <p>In the early stages of my design, I struggled to isolate and highlight the everyday objects I included without letting the background clutter the screen. I ended up cutting them out of the images via Photoshop and using the green color I selected to highlight them for a sticker-like effect that draws in the eye. I also opted to simplify the graphics by relying on text accompanying the images instead of using callouts or a magnified view (seen left) like I tried in some earlier iterations. This also opened the door for creative text transitions.</p>

            <h2>User Interface</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="side-by-side3">
                    <p>My interface includes two options for moving through the project flow: scrolling and a clickable navigation arrow that automatically scrolls to the next section. These both stay consistent throughout, and can be used interchangeably. Another interactive element I included was a slider on two occasions. Both are styled identically, and use labels to indicate their functionality. For both the sliders and the arrow navigation, I kept them consistent to avoid confusion and allow the user to seamlessly navigate the project without much thought. Upon moving the slider, the user receives instant feedback via changes in the information displayed. For example, when guessing the lifespan of a broiler chicken, as soon as the user releases the slider, the answer appears as a dot on the slider line (seen on the right).</p>

                <div class="side-by-side4">
                    <img src="images/hover.jpg">

                    <p>I focused heavily on reducing the amount of information available in each stage, and instead chunking it into digestible phrases and allowing the user to flow from one to the next. I wanted to avoid walls of text, and instead raise short questions and provide quotes to encourage the user to reflect. For the denser sections with longer quotes or pieces of information, the user interacts with individual elements via hover to display bits of information one at a time. This way, there is never an overloading amount of textual information visible at a time.</p>

                <div class="side-by-side1">
                    <p>There are a few overlays that appear throughout the projects. All of them have a consistent look - a solid outline and basic cross for closing - and function the same way to maintain consistency. The first one is intended to clarify the manner in which the user can interact with the hoverable elements. The other two are located in the footer and allow the user to view sources and images used, as well as navigate to them via links.</p>

                <p>When conducting user testing, I discovered that the scroll mechanism was not at all intuitive for everyone. This prompted me to add the alternate way of navigating - the navigation arrow. The hoverable elements also prompted some confusion, and users had trouble voluntarily displaying the text by controlling it with their pointer. To address this, I added an instructional overlay.</p>

                <p>The section of my project focused on the future was originally intended to statically showcase two possible futures: one with animal agriculture and one without (seen below on the left). This part was not yet fleshed out when doing user testing. However, when showing my project in class and communicating my idea for alternate future timelines with peers and the teaching team, I received feedback that a more dynamic approach via a timeline that displays the future may be more effective. I pivoted and overhauled my design for this section, transforming it into a timeline with illustrations (below on the right).</p>

                </div>
                
                <p>When testing the project on different desktop sizes, I noticed that the navigation arrow did not appropriately scroll between sections. I revised this to adapt to different screen sizes.</p>

                <p>Going forward, if I were to further develop the project I would stray away from mellow content to really drive the message in deeper. I avoided graphic images, but in hindsight I think they might have their place in such a project. I would also incorporate animations into the exploration of the future, to add a dynamic element among otherwise rather static interactions.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>I learned a lot about the value of the research aspect of project development. I struggled with creative burnout amidst the busy quarter, and had a hard time coming up with strong concepts and presentation styles. Looking at other projects for inspiration and researching relevant information helped bring back a sense of direction.</p>

                <p>Though working with new features of Javascript and familiarizing myself with new libraries proved tedious at times, I found the conceptual aspect of the project to be most challenging. Mind-mapping and talking to others was most helpful in working through this.</p>

                <p>I’m proud of being able to achieve the vision I created once I fleshed out my mockups. I was not sure how I would create all the effects and interactions, but figured I would learn and pick it up throughout the process, which proved to be true.</p>
