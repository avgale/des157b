            <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>
            <p>My topic is the environmental and ethical impacts of human activity, which I will be tackling independently. I will explore the concept of human activities that have been normalized, though the ethical and environmental implications are scary when examined. My goals are to challenge mental models about what is considered acceptable by leaning into emotional narratives as well as data visualizations that highlight negative impacts.
            <br>
            <br>
            I intend to include specific stories that zoom into human impacts at the macro level and emotionally appeal to the viewer. I would also like to lean into the logic and reasoning by breaking down and displaying data about greenhouse emissions and other environmental changes, and combining these with illustrations of a dystopian future if these trends continue. The format I have in mind is a scroll narrative, potentially one that includes maps that zoom into different features of the planet and stories that take place there. Contrasting the potential dystopian future with a potential utopian one that includes speculative designs meant to inspire hope could also be an option. An alternative to scrolling could be a 3D model of Earth.
            <br>
            <br>
            I struggled to work with data visualization while exploring libraries for this purpose, so I am a bit worried about working with data again at a larger scale. There might also be a significant amount of data processing required beforehand, which could slow down progress. Depending on how many illustrations I include, the process of creating them could be a bottleneck as well.</p>
