            <h1>Usability Test Results</h1>
            <p>The scroll was not intuitive to the user testing my project, and it took her a while to realize that it was the main way to interact with the project. I realized that there is no indication that the user should scroll, and so I plan to add an arrow at the bottom of the page to indicate this. When I asked how she would interpret an arrow, she mentioned that we would try to click it. The user also tried to scroll very quickly and struggled to pause at the right moments when information fades in. Because of her inclination to click the arrow and the struggle with scrolling, I will be adding an arrow that jumps to the next section fully faded in upon clicking.</p>

            <img src="images/hover-icons.jpg" alt="screenshot from usability test">

            <p>In the above pictured section with hoverable icons that make text appear, she was not able to figure out how to make the text stay long enough to read because she kept moving her mouse off of the icons. She did not understand that the text visibility was connected to hovering, and so I think displaying all icons and adding an overlay or similar with text indicating to hover when first entering that section could resolve this issue.</p>

            <p>In terms of project impact, when asked about takeaways and feelings, she summarized the intended message very effectively, and expressed that it gave way to guilt and worry. She also expressed that the amount of textual information is well balanced. Therefore, the message is clear and I will build upon it by finalizing the future timeline section.</p>
