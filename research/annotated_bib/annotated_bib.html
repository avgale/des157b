                    <p>N. I. A. Higuita, R. LaRocque, and A. McGushin, “Climate change, industrial animal agriculture, and the role of physicians – Time to act,” The Journal of Climate Change and Health, vol. 13, p. 100260, Jul. 2023, doi: <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2667278223000603?via%3Dihub">10.1016/j.joclim.2023.100260.</a></p>
                    <p>This article highlights the negative environmental impacts of animal agriculture, and provides data outlining the consequences of continuing the current practices. Besides greenhouse gas emissions, dire consequences for human health including animal-borne illnesses and the meat and dairy industries’ contributions to antimicrobial resistance are touched upon. The article also discusses the need for change in human diets to avoid environmental disaster and to encourage human health. Incorporating the statistics about greenhouse gases, illnesses, and bacterial resistance into the capstone project can provide hard evidence that is compelling to the user and encourages them to reflect upon their own everyday actions and lifestyle. The multi-faceted nature of the problem is well-highlighted by the article, which I would like to lean into for my own project.</p>

                    <p>V. Sandler, “The environmental cost of animal agriculture,” IAPWA, Jul. 03, 2024. <a href="https://iapwa.org/the-environmental-cost-of-animal-agriculture/">https://iapwa.org/the-environmental-cost-of-animal-agriculture/</a></p>
                    <p>Besides briefly mentioning a few unethical practices in animal agriculture, the article focuses primarily on greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, water consumption, and water pollution as a result of animal agriculture. It provides a statistical comparison of scenarios where animal consumption were to continue as it currently is, and a world where plant-based diets were the norm. Portraying these two futures in my project could show a vision of despair as well as hope, depending which future the user interacts with. Combined with the other environmental implications touched upon by other articles, the data from this one can provide a more holistic view of the environmental impacts of animal husbandry.</p>

                    <p>The Humane Society of the United States, “The welfare of cows in the dairy industry,” Animal Studies Repository, 2009. <a href="https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/hsus_reps_impacts_on_animals/20/">https://www.wellbeingintlstudiesrepository.org/hsus_reps_impacts_on_animals/20/</a></p>
                    <p>This article goes into depth about the processes associated with raising cows and obtaining milk in the dairy industry. It covers a number of inhumane practices spanning reproduction, milk production, slaughter, living conditions, mutilation, transport, and hormonal manipulation, among others. All the practices mentioned have highly questionable ethical implications, and are frequently not well publicized. Highlighting some of these in my capstone project brings both a shock factor and emotional appeal to the viewer. The extreme nature of these practices leaves a lot of room for better alternatives to be explored, potentially by allowing the viewer to interact with alternative futures.</p>
